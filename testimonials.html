    <h1> My Journey </h1>
    <p>Todayâ€™s generation, technology nowadays is very powerful tools. It is very useful in every aspect that we do. Over the past few weeks, I realize that Im not that good in technology because I lack of something. I am learning more and more things about different programs to design my own ideas, doing PowerPoints, and making Excels. I know that technology is not easy but all I need is to love what Im doing. As I get to know more about technology, I started to learned and understand more about technology.</p>
    <p>At first, we were just taught about the parts of the computer, the seven essential parts of the computer, about PowerPoints, excels and etc. but I realiazed its not. What I like about learning from PowerPoints was making slides, especially when the instructor taught us about slide master and inserting pictures inside the circle.  From that day As I reflect on my computer skill development, I have gained a lot from them, as well as how each have impacted my professional, and personal development. Each day brings a new experience in working with technology more likely in computer.</p>
    <p>	Therefore, learning technology is not easy but its kind a challenging for me. As an implementer/educator my personal observation has showed me that technology is a positive tool in the classroom. It brings advantages in the teaching process both for educators and for learners. Motivation and changes of attitude arise when efficiently employed. To reach a good understanding on the use of technology, it is necessary to receive instruction, it is necessary to rethink its use, apply accurate methods, and design new possibilities that better reach the goal of the class, inside and outside the educational room.</p>
